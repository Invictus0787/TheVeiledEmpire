            <h3>Book II: The Raven's Runes</h3>
            <p>
                In the frozen north of Nordenheim, the restless sea stirs with the rise of viking warlords and bloodthirsty raiders. As ancient runes foretell of a conflict yet to come, the northern wastes beckon, where the cold steel of the north will clash with the might of the imperium—and only the gods will decide who stands victorious.

            <h3>Book III: The Forgotten Prophet</h3>
            <p>
                Beneath the blistering sun of Javasfar, the shifting sands whisper of a forgotten prophecy. As the Sultanate verges on the edge of collapse, the Imperial Trading Company weaves its influence, but beyond the Dune Seas, a figure emerges—one who might unite the desert tribes under a single banner, igniting a fire that could burn the empire itself.

            <h3>Book IV: The Red Horde</h3>
            <p>
                Far beyond the Shield Wall, winds of war begin to howl. Tales of a long-forgotten terror echo through the east—the Akhutai ride once more. As the imperium braces itself for an invasion thought to be legend, the tides of destiny surge, and a storm of blood and conquest begins to gather on the horizon.

            <p>
                From the shadows of forgotten realms, Noctyra returns with the ancient power of the Void at her command. As darkness creeps across Valara, spanning continents and realms, an empire is thrown into chaos. The imperator’s lineage trembles as the gods and mortals alike brace for a reckoning that will reshape the world.
